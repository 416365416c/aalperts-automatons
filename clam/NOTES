Git username is your user[1], human-readable CLAM data gets stored in the git notes under the 'clam' namespace. CLAM data is always tied to a commit, until you print all the notes as the first draft of your change log.
Sharing of git notes is possible, but not too easy so the tool probably needs to provide some shared sync capabilities
[1] There is no authentication. Ergo there should be no authorization. No secret RLM mode, all comments and checks are visible (if you push)
