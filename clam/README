Change Log Automation Machine

Requirements:

Qt 5.1 including QtQuick.Controls
git commands are run, recent git required (>=1.6.6)

Usage:

Run in the target git repo. To work on a managable number of commits, pass a single argument as the git log range (such as 'v5.0.0..HEAD').

Notes and seen list are stored as notes (refs/notes/clam) in the git repo. All changes are automatically saved.


Future:

UI was thrown together a bit hurridly, the QML files probably need to be re-written.
Sync between users so as to actually use the other user data
Separate Local->mobile sync to work on the go
